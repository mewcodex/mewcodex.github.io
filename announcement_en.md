# Announcement

Recent updates: Many bugs fixed, but many bugs still remain. Added ability range previews and improved readability of ability damage formulas. If you have any questions, contact me via Bilibili DM or submit an issue on GitHub.

Current progress:

* Abilities:
  - Ability values are still somewhat inaccurate (they are derived from effects in-game)
  - Ability descriptions are complete and displayed in the same way as in-game
  - May add some enemy abilities, scene abilities, etc. later
  - Ability ranges still need more testing
* Passives & disorders:
  - Still need to add some effect icons
* Items:
  - May consider adding item pool display
* Mutations:
  - Cat body part previews are not available yet
* Characters (units):
  - Missing a lot of information because character files are too complex
  - Images only include entries with in-game portraits; may render common scene props later
