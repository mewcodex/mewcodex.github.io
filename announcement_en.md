# Announcement

Recent updates: Added some content unlocking methods and a new table for achievement unlock conditions. Mobile view optimization. 
The new game version update is not closely related to the codex, so game resources have not been updated yet.
If you have any questions, contact me via Bilibili DM or submit an issue on GitHub.

Current progress:

* Abilities:
  - Ability values are still somewhat inaccurate (derived from effects in-game)
  - Ability descriptions are complete and displayed in the same way as in-game
  - May add some enemy abilities, scene abilities, etc. later
  - Ability ranges still need more testing
  - Ability pool mechanics are not fully understood yet, so this is for reference only
  - Considering adding dependency links between abilities/passives/items in the future
* Passives & disorders:
  - Largely complete
* Items:
  - May consider adding item pool display
* Mutations:
  - Cat body part previews are not available yet
* Characters (units):
  - Missing a lot of information because character files are too complex
  - Images only include entries with in-game portraits; may render common scene props later
* Achievements:
  - Largely complete; may add icons to improve readability (area icons are not very distinct)
