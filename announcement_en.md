# Announcement

Current progress:

* Abilities:
	- Ability numbers are still a bit inaccurate (they are derived from effects in-game)
	- Ability descriptions are finished and displayed in the same way as in-game
	- May add some enemy abilities and scene abilities later
		* Ability ranges:
			- The mechanics are too complex and need more testing
			- Source code is provided for preview and comparison
* Passives & disorders:
	- Largely complete
	- Some abilities without descriptions will get notes later
	- Still need to add some effect icons
* Items:
	- Largely complete
	- May consider adding item pool display
* Mutations:
	- Cat body part previews are not available yet
* Characters (units):
	- Missing a lot of information because character files are too complex
	- Images only include entries with in-game portraits; may render common scene props later
